Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.
See Documentation/00-INDEX for a list of what is contained in each file.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.

# Multipath TCP (MPTCP) Tools

This repository holds a set of tools (and instrumentation) for the MPTCP kernel v0.94 specifically targeting the MPTCP packet scheduler. The modifications and tools were built as part of a project published at ACM MobiCom 2019.

The repo is ported to MPTCP kernel v0.95.1 from https://github.com/swetanksaha/mptcp-tools.
